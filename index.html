    <p>The chatbots responses are generated by llama3.2 (3b) which is run locally and is told that it is an assistant and that the red block goes in the left bucket and the blue block goes in the right bucket
    The chatbot is able to give instructions on how to complete the task. The text to speech is done using elevenlabs api however with the I am running out of api credits for the free version.
